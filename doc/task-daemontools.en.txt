Cinnamon::Task::Daemontools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tasks for daemontools servers.

* Service templates

These tasks are not intended as part of the deployment process or to
be used to control remote server proesses, but might be useful to
prepare the initial revision of daemontools service scripts.

  $ ./cin @ROLE daemontools:service_template:create\ SOURCE\ DEST

... will create a directory |./config/service.in/DEST/| and put
templates for daemontools service scripts by copying files from
<https://github.com/wakaba/perl-setupenv/tree/master/templates/daemontools/SOURCE/>.

  $ ./cin @ROLE daemontools:service_template:create_installer

... will create |./Makefile.service|, which can be used to generate
daemontools service scripts from templates in |./config/service.in|.
See comments in the |Makefile.service| for how it can be used.
